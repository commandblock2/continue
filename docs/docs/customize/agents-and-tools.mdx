Tools allow Continue to take action in your IDE and beyond (when you give permission). Currently, they are only supported for the following providers:

- [Anthropic](./model-providers/top-level/anthropic.mdx) - see recommended models [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#choosing-a-model).
- [Ollama](./model-providers/top-level/ollama.mdx) - see recommended models [here](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools).
- [OpenAI](./model-providers/top-level/openai.mdx)
- [Gemini](./model-providers/top-level/gemini.mdx)

### Using Tools

To use tools, select the "Agent" mode from the dropdown menu in the input toolbar. This activates the tool-calling functionality.

To balance speed and safety, each tool can be set to 1 of 3 modes:

- `Automatic`: When the LLM requests to use the tool, Continue will automatically call it and send the response to the LLM.
- `Ask First`: When the LLM requests to use the tool, Continue will first give you the opportunity to "Cancel" or "Continue" with the tool.
- `Excluded`: The LLM will not know about or be able to use the tool.

You can configure these settings in the Tools panel, which can be accessed by clicking on the tools icon in the interface.

### Custom tools

Currently custom tools can be configured using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction),a standard proposed by Anthropic to unify prompts, context, and tool use.

MCP Servers can be added to hub Assistants using `mcpServers` blocks. You can explore available MCP server blocks [here](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/mcp).

To set up your own MCP server, read the [MCP quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) and then [create an `mcpServers` block](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=block&blockType=mcpServers) or add the following to your [config file](../customize/deep-dives/configuration.md):

<Tabs groupId="config-example">
  <TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">
  ```yaml title="config.yaml"
  mcpServers:
    - name: My MCP Server
      command: uvx
      args:
        - mcp-server-sqlite
        - --db-path
        - /Users/NAME/test.db
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
